# `pygrep`

## What is `pre-commit`?

`pre-commit` is a cool tool that will run either checks or formatters on your codee during the git commit stage. `pre-commit` hooks allow you to make a refactor, and then ensure the old pattern won't creep back in!

There are lots of great hooks out there, but one to be especially mindful of is `pygrep` because of its flexibility.
