# Useful python pre-commit hooks

## What should I use?

There's not much code in this section. This is just a place for me to share my favorite python `pre-commit` hooks! All these are great

1. [Python black](https://github.com/psf/black)
  - all around formatter
2. [Pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade/)
  - remove old syntax
3. [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort)
  - sort your imports
  - alternatively, [reorder_python_imports](https://github.com/asottile/reorder_python_imports)
4. [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/)
  - enforce your type checking
