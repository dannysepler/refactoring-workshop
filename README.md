# Refactoring Workshop

This workshop teaches tools useful for broad rewrites of code.

## Requirements

I use a Mac, so some of these commands may not work for Windows. If you
find such a command, please leave a github issue on this repo with the
equivalent command and I'll add it in!

A working installation of python >=3.6 and some knowledge of python will be
helpful for section four.
